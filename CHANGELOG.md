# DEPRECATED - File Removed

This file has been removed as part of GitHub issue #232 root directory cleanup.

**Reason for removal**: Changelog content should be managed via GitHub releases and issue tracking per CLAUDE.md policy, not standalone .md files.

**Content preserved**: Historical changelog information has been preserved in git history and should be managed through proper GitHub release processes going forward.

**Policy reference**: See CLAUDE.md - "Use GitHub Issues for ALL planning and documentation, NOT additional .md files"
