# DEPRECATED - File Moved

This file has been moved to infra/docs/CHANGELOG.md as part of GitHub issue #282 root directory cleanup.

**New location**: infra/docs/CHANGELOG.md

**Reason for move**: Following L1/L2 module architecture - documentation files belong in infra/docs/ directory, not root.

**Note**: As per CLAUDE.md policy, changelog content should be managed via GitHub releases and issue tracking, not standalone .md files.

**Policy reference**: See CLAUDE.md - "MODULAR FILE PLACEMENT: All files must be in appropriate L1/L2 directories - avoid root directory unless essential"
