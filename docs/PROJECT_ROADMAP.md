# My Finance DCF Investment Analysis Tool - Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Core Objectives
Build a Graph RAG system based on SEC filings and multi-source data, supporting end-to-end DCF valuation for investment analysis.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

**Existing Capabilities**:
- ✅ Yahoo Finance data collection (stock prices, company info)
- ✅ SEC Edgar filing downloads
- ✅ Neo4j graph database basic models
- ✅ Configuration-driven task system
- ✅ Local LLM support framework (Ollama)

**Major Gaps**:
- ❌ SEC filing content parsing and structured storage
- ❌ Multi-source data validation mechanisms
- ❌ DCF calculation engine
- ❌ Graph RAG query system
- ❌ Q&A interface and scoring system
