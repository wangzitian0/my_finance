# My Finance Project Architecture Documentation

This directory contains **architecture and design documentation** for the My Finance DCF investment analysis tool.

> **Note**: Implementation-specific documentation has been moved to respective component directories. See the links below for implemented features.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Strategy

This documentation follows a **separation of concerns** approach:

- **`docs/`** - Architecture, design, and high-level system documentation
- **Component READMEs** - Implementation details, usage guides, and feature-specific documentation
- **Main README** - Project overview and quick start guide

---

*Architecture documentation is maintained as the system evolves. Implementation details are maintained with their respective components.*
