### Decision
Implement three-stage ETL pipeline: Extract → Transform → Load with date partitioning

### Rationale
- **Data Warehouse Compatibility**: Industry-standard ETL patterns
- **Incremental Processing**: Date partitions enable efficient updates
- **Observability**: Clear stage separation for monitoring and debugging
- **Scalability**: Each stage can be optimized independently

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enterprise-grade data processing, clear data lineage
- **Negative**: Increased complexity compared to direct processing
- **Mitigations**: Comprehensive documentation and automation tools

## ADR-003: Graph Database for Financial Data

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-07-30  
**Context**: Complex relationships between financial entities

### Decision
Use Neo4j as primary database for financial entity relationships

### Rationale
- **Relationship Modeling**: Natural fit for financial entity connections
- **Query Performance**: Efficient traversal of complex relationships
- **Graph RAG Support**: Native graph structure for AI reasoning
- **ACID Compliance**: Transaction safety for financial data

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Powerful relationship queries, excellent RAG foundation
- **Negative**: Learning curve, specialized database skills required
- **Mitigations**: ORM layer (neomodel), comprehensive documentation

## ADR-004: Anti-Duplicate Download System

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Context**: Need to minimize API quota usage and improve efficiency

### Decision
Implement comprehensive metadata tracking system with MD5 verification

### Rationale
- **API Quota Management**: Expensive third-party API calls
- **Development Efficiency**: Faster development cycles without re-downloads
- **Data Integrity**: MD5 verification ensures file integrity
- **Partial Retry**: Granular retry of only failed downloads

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Significant quota savings, faster development iteration
- **Negative**: Additional complexity in metadata management
- **Mitigations**: Automated metadata management tools

## ADR-005: Pixi for Cross-Platform Package Management

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Context**: Need cross-platform development environment consistency

### Decision
Replace conda/pipenv with Pixi for package management

### Rationale
- **Cross-Platform**: Single tool for macOS/Linux/Windows
- **Reproducible Environments**: Exact dependency resolution
- **Task Management**: Built-in task runner capabilities
- **Modern Tooling**: Fast, reliable, actively maintained

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent environments, reduced setup complexity
- **Negative**: Migration effort, new tool adoption
- **Mitigations**: Comprehensive migration guide, automation scripts

## ADR-006: Configuration-Driven Dataset Building

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Context**: Support multiple dataset configurations without code duplication

### Decision
Implement unified build system with YAML configuration files

### Rationale
- **DRY Principle**: One codebase supports all dataset tiers
- **Maintainability**: Single point of configuration management
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new dataset configurations
- **Validation**: Schema-based configuration validation

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Reduced code duplication, centralized configuration
- **Negative**: Configuration complexity for large datasets
- **Mitigations**: Configuration validation tools, comprehensive examples

## ADR-007: Build Tracking and Manifest Generation

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Context**: Need comprehensive build execution documentation

### Decision
Implement BuildTracker with detailed manifest generation for each execution

### Rationale
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of what was built when
- **Reproducibility**: Ability to recreate exact build conditions
- **Debugging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting build issues
- **Compliance**: Documentation for regulatory requirements

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Complete traceability, easier debugging
- **Negative**: Additional storage requirements for build artifacts
- **Mitigations**: Configurable retention policies, automated cleanup

## ADR-008: Documentation Separation of Concerns

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-08-10  
**Context**: Need clear documentation architecture

### Decision
Three-tier documentation: docs/ (architecture) + Issues (tasks) + Wiki (tutorials)

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Architecture vs implementation vs tutorials
- **Maintainability**: Co-located documentation with code
- **Discoverability**: Clear navigation hierarchy
- **Collaboration**: Appropriate tools for different audiences

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear documentation hierarchy, easier maintenance
- **Negative**: More complex navigation for new users
- **Mitigations**: Comprehensive cross-linking, clear navigation guides
