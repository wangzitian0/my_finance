# ADR-139: Sub-Agent Design for Quantitative Trading Operations

## Status
**Proposed** - Implementation planned for Issue #139

## Context

The financial strategy engine currently operates through a comprehensive `p3` command system with 100+ commands spanning environment management, data processing, DCF analysis, and workflow automation. As the system scales to handle VTI-3500+ companies and increasingly complex quantitative trading operations, there's an opportunity to implement specialized sub-agents that can automate routine processes and provide domain expertise.

This ADR analyzes the VoltAgent sub-agent architecture patterns and designs a comprehensive sub-agent system tailored for quantitative trading operations.

### Current System Analysis

#### Architecture Overview
- **SEC Filing-Enhanced Graph RAG System**: 336 SEC documents with semantic retrieval

- **Unified p3 CLI**: 100+ commands across 8 categories
- **ETL Pipeline**: Stage-based processing with semantic embeddings
- **DCF Engine**: Automated valuation with regulatory backing

#### Process Categories Identified
1. **Environment Management** (8 commands): Infrastructure setup, service management
2. **Development Operations** (6 commands): Code quality, testing, validation
3. **Data Pipeline Operations** (12 commands): Build management, ETL processing
