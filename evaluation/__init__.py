"""
Strategy Evaluation and Backtesting System

Independent evaluation system for testing investment strategies generated by
the engine/ module. Provides backtesting, performance metrics, and benchmark
comparison capabilities.

Business Purpose:
Validate investment strategies through historical backtesting and generate
performance metrics to assess strategy effectiveness.

Data Flow:
Investment Strategies → Historical Backtesting → Performance Returns

This module operates independently of the strategy generation engine to provide
unbiased evaluation of investment strategies using historical data.

Key Components:
- backtesting/: Historical strategy simulation
- metrics/: Performance calculation and analysis
- benchmarks/: Comparison with market indices
- validation/: Strategy validation frameworks
- reporting/: Evaluation report generation

Clear Business Separation:
- engine/: Generates strategies from current data
- evaluation/: Tests strategies against historical data
- No circular dependencies between generation and evaluation

Issue #256: Moved from analysis/evaluation/ to root evaluation/ to emphasize
this is a separate business function from strategy generation, providing
independent validation of investment strategies.
