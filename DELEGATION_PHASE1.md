# Phase 1: Issue Management Framework Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Delegation to git-ops-agent

### Primary Objective
Implement automated issue complexity assessment and parent-child breakdown strategy to resolve the current problem with issue #165 being too large (3 phases, 21 days).

### Specific Requirements

#### 1. Issue Complexity Assessment Automation
Create automated detection and flagging system for oversized issues:

**Size Indicators (Issue is too large if)**:
- Duration > 5 days estimated work
- Multiple distinct phases or systems involved  
- More than 3 different agent specializations required
- Dependencies that could create blocking scenarios

**Implementation Needed**:
- GitHub issue template with complexity assessment
- Automated flagging system for large issues
- Integration with agent-coordinator delegation system

#### 2. Parent-Child Issue Linking Strategy
Establish systematic approach to breaking down complex issues:

**Root Issue Structure** (like current #165):
```markdown
# [Root Issue Title] - Implementation Strategy

## Overview
Brief description of the overall objective and why it's being broken down.

## Child Issues Strategy
- **Phase 1**: [#XXX] - [Focused area 1] (Est: 2-3 days)
- **Phase 2**: [#XXX] - [Focused area 2] (Est: 2-3 days)  
- **Phase 3**: [#XXX] - [Focused area 3] (Est: 2-3 days)

## Dependencies
- Issue X must complete before Issue Y
- Cross-issue coordination points

## Success Criteria
Overall completion metrics and validation approach.
```

**Child Issue Structure**:
```markdown
# [Specific Implementation] - Part of #[ROOT]

## Scope
Single, focused objective with clear deliverables.

## Implementation Plan
1. Specific step 1
2. Specific step 2
3. Testing and validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deliverable 1 complete
- [ ] Deliverable 2 complete
- [ ] Tests passing

## Parent Issue
Links back to #[ROOT] (Root Issue)
```

#### 3. Apply Framework to Current Issue #165
**Immediate Action Required**: Break down the current oversized issue #165 using the new framework:

**Recommended Breakdown for #165**:
- **Root Issue #165**: "Sub-Agent System Enhancement Strategy" 
- **Child #165A**: "Issue Management Framework Implementation" (This current phase)
- **Child #165B**: "HRBP and RevOps Agent Creation" 
- **Child #165C**: "Agent-Coordinator Optimization and Streamlining"

### Implementation Deliverables

1. **GitHub Issue Templates**: 
   - Complex issue assessment template
   - Parent issue template with child linking
   - Child issue template with parent references

2. **Automation Scripts**:
   - Issue complexity detection
   - Automated breakdown recommendations
   - Parent-child linking validation

3. **Documentation**:
   - Issue breakdown best practices guide
   - Agent coordination workflow with issue management
   - Examples of successful breakdowns

4. **Integration**:
   - Update agent-coordinator delegation to consider issue complexity
   - Ensure learning system captures breakdown patterns
   - Connect with GitHub issue labels for agent routing

### Success Criteria

**Immediate Success** (Within 2-3 days):
- Issue #165 properly broken down into manageable child issues
- Each child issue estimated at 2-3 days maximum
- Clear dependencies mapped between child issues
- Agent specialization properly aligned with each child

**System Success** (Ongoing):
- Future issues >5 days automatically flagged
- Breakdown templates readily available
- Parent-child linking working smoothly
- Integration with agent delegation system functional

### Technical Requirements

**GitHub Integration**:
- Issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Automated workflows for complexity detection
- Label integration for agent routing
- Cross-references for parent-child linking

**Agent Coordination**:
- Integration with current label-to-agent mapping
- Support for multi-issue task coordination
- Learning data collection across related issues
- Progress tracking for complex multi-issue projects

### Next Phase Preparation

Once Phase 1 is complete, this framework will be used to create properly sized issues for:
- Phase 2: HRBP and RevOps agent creation
- Phase 3: Agent-coordinator optimization

The git-ops-agent should ensure the framework supports these upcoming complex tasks and can handle them efficiently.
