# Environment Management - Development Environment Setup and Monitoring

Comprehensive development environment management, service orchestration, and system health monitoring supporting the financial analysis platform.

## Overview

This directory provides essential environment management tools for setting up, monitoring, and maintaining the development environment. These tools ensure consistent, reliable development experiences across different systems and configurations.

## Core Components

### Environment Status Monitoring (`env_status.py`)
**Unified environment health checking and service status validation**:
- **Service status verification**: Minikube, Neo4j, Pixi environment monitoring
- **Comprehensive diagnostics**: IP addresses, connection details, service health
- **Quick command reference**: Common development operations and troubleshooting
- **Integration ready**: Used by P3 commands for environment validation

### Service Management (`shutdown_all.py`)
**Graceful service shutdown and environment cleanup**:
- **Service coordination**: Orderly shutdown of all development services
- **Resource cleanup**: Container cleanup, process termination, resource release
- **Safe shutdown**: Prevents data loss, ensures clean environment state
- **Reset integration**: Used by P3 reset command for complete environment reset

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Environment Validation
**Complete development environment health monitoring**:

**Service Status Checking**:
```python
# Minikube cluster validation
def check_minikube():
    if success and "Running" in output:
        print("‚úÖ Minikube is running")
        print(f"üìç Minikube IP: {ip}")
        return ip
    else:
        print("‚ùå Minikube is not running")
        print("üí° Start with: p3 ready")
```

**Neo4j Database Monitoring**:
```python
# Neo4j service and connectivity validation
def check_neo4j(minikube_ip):
    if success and "Running" in output:
        print("‚úÖ Neo4j is running")
        print(f"üåê Web Interface: http://{minikube_ip}:30474")
        print(f"üîå Bolt Connection: bolt://{minikube_ip}:30687")
        print("üîë Credentials: neo4j / finance123")
```

**Development Environment Verification**:
```python
# Pixi environment and project configuration
def check_pixi():
    if "PIXI_ENV_DIR" in os.environ and Path("pixi.toml").exists():
        print("‚úÖ Pixi environment is active")
        print("‚úÖ Project configuration found")
        return True
```

### 2. Service Orchestration
**Coordinated management of all development services**:

**Service Dependencies**:
- **Minikube**: Container runtime and Kubernetes cluster
- **Neo4j**: Graph database for financial data relationships

- **Resource monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage tracking
- **Performance validation**: Response time monitoring, throughput testing
- **Dependency verification**: Service interdependency health checking

### 3. Development Workflow Integration
**Seamless integration with P3 workflow system**:

**Command Integration**:
- **p3 ready**: Uses environment setup and validation tools
- **p3 debug**: Leverages comprehensive diagnostics and status checking
- **p3 reset**: Integrates with service shutdown and cleanup procedures
- **Workflow validation**: Pre-flight checks for PR creation and testing

**Troubleshooting Support**:
```python
def show_quick_commands():
    print("üöÄ Quick Commands:")
    print("  Environment:")
    print("    p3 ready    - Start all services")
    print("    p3 debug    - This status check")
    print("    p3 reset    - Reset everything")
```
