# Deployment Automation Module

**Infrastructure deployment and orchestration tools**

## Module Structure

```
infra/deployment/
├── README.md              # This documentation
└── ../ansible/            # Ansible deployment configurations (existing)
└── ../k8s/                # Kubernetes deployment manifests (existing)
```

## Existing Infrastructure

### Ansible Configurations (`../ansible/`)
**Automated deployment and environment setup**
- `setup.yml` - Main environment setup playbook
- `roles/` - Ansible role definitions for various components
  - `repo_code.yml` - Code repository management
  - `repo_data.yml` - Data repository management  
  - `neo4j_check_restart.yml` - Neo4j service management

**Usage**:
```bash
# Main environment setup
ansible-playbook infra/ansible/setup.yml

# Development environment initialization
ansible-playbook infra/ansible/setup.yml --tags development
```

### Kubernetes Manifests (`../k8s/`)
**Container orchestration and service deployment**
- Kubernetes deployment manifests for production services
- Service definitions for Neo4j, monitoring, and application components
- ConfigMaps and Secret management for secure configuration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Deploy all services
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/

# Deploy specific components
kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/neo4j-deployment.yaml
```

## Integration with P3 Workflow

### Environment Management
```bash
p3 ready            # Uses ansible/setup.yml for environment initialization
p3 reset            # Clean shutdown and restart using deployment automation
p3 debug            # Status checking using deployment health checks
```

### Service Orchestration
- **Development**: Ansible-managed local services with Docker/Minikube
- **Production**: Kubernetes-orchestrated containerized services
- **Testing**: Isolated test environments with deployment automation

## Modular Architecture Benefits

### Centralized Deployment Logic
- All deployment configurations in one location
- Consistent deployment patterns across environments
- Unified configuration management and versioning

### Environment Isolation
- **Development**: Local services via Ansible
- **Testing**: Containerized test environments
- **Production**: Kubernetes cluster deployment
- **Staging**: Hybrid approach with production-like configuration

## Deployment Workflows

### Standard Deployment Process
1. **Environment Preparation**: Ansible setup and configuration
2. **Service Deployment**: Kubernetes manifest application
3. **Health Validation**: Automated service health checks
4. **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback on deployment failure

### Cross-Environment Consistency
- Shared configuration templates across development/production
- Environment-specific variable override mechanisms
- Consistent service discovery and networking patterns

## Migration Notes

**Infrastructure Modularization**: Existing ansible/ and k8s/ directories remain in their current locations for backward compatibility. The deployment module provides organizational documentation and future expansion capability while maintaining existing workflows.

**Future Enhancements**:
- Terraform integration for infrastructure as code
- GitOps workflows for automated deployment
- Multi-cloud deployment capability
- Enhanced monitoring and observability integration

**Usage**: Reference existing ansible/ and k8s/ directories for current deployment automation. This module provides organizational structure for future deployment tool expansion and integration.
