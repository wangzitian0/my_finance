# DEPRECATED - File Moved

This file has been moved to tests/pytest.ini as part of GitHub issue #282 root directory cleanup.

**New location**: tests/pytest.ini

**Reason for move**: Following L1/L2 module architecture - testing configuration belongs in tests/ directory, not root.

**Policy reference**: See CLAUDE.md - "MODULAR FILE PLACEMENT: All files must be in appropriate L1/L2 directories - avoid root directory unless essential"
