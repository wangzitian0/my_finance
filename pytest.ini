# DEPRECATED - File Moved to tests/pytest.ini (Issue #282)

# This file has been moved to tests/pytest.ini as part of GitHub issue #282 root directory cleanup.

# New location: tests/pytest.ini
# To run tests: pytest (will automatically find configuration in tests/)

# Reason for move: Following L1/L2 module architecture - testing configuration files belong in tests/ directory, not root.

# Policy reference: See CLAUDE.md - "MODULAR FILE PLACEMENT: All files must be in appropriate L1/L2 directories - avoid root directory unless essential"
