# Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

**Authority**: HRBP Agent (Cross-agent communication protocol specifications)
**Implementation**: Agent-Coordinator (Orchestration and coordination)
**Purpose**: Solve "sub-agent ËøòÊòØÊúâÁÇπÂÆπÊòìÊñ≠ÂºÄÔºåÊ≤°ÊúâÂÆûÁé∞‰ªñ‰ª¨Áõ∏‰∫íÂïÜÈáèÁöÑÊïàÊûú" problem

## üîó CRITICAL COMMUNICATION GAPS ADDRESSED

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: "ÁõÆÂâç sub-agent ËøòÊòØÊúâÁÇπÂÆπÊòìÊñ≠ÂºÄÔºåÊ≤°ÊúâÂÆûÁé∞‰ªñ‰ª¨Áõ∏‰∫íÂïÜÈáèÁöÑÊïàÊûú"

**ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED**:
1. **Context Loss**: Agents operate in isolation without shared context
2. **No Handoff Protocols**: No structured way to pass information between agents
3. **Session Disconnection**: Agents can't maintain continuity across task boundaries
4. **No Coordination Mechanisms**: No practical way for agents to "discuss" approaches

## üõ†Ô∏è PRACTICAL COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS

### 1. **Context Passing Protocol** (IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION)

#### **Agent Handoff Template** 
```typescript
interface AgentHandoff {
  from_agent: string;
  to_agent: string;
  context: {
    task_summary: string;
    completed_work: string[];
    current_state: object;
    dependencies: string[];
    next_steps: string[];
    blocking_issues?: string[];
    recommendations: string[];
  };
  communication_type: "handoff" | "consultation" | "collaboration";
  urgency: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
}
```

#### **Example: Data Pipeline ‚Üí DCF Analysis Handoff**
```typescript
// Data Engineer completes ETL, passes context to Quant Research
const handoff: AgentHandoff = {
  from_agent: "data-engineer-agent",
  to_agent: "quant-research-agent", 
  context: {
    task_summary: "SEC filing data processing for M7 companies completed",
    completed_work: [
      "Downloaded 10-K filings for AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA, META, AMZN",
      "Extracted financial statements and cash flow data",
      "Validated data quality - 99.2% completeness rate",
      "Stored processed data in build_data/stage_02_processed/dcf_ready/"
    ],
    current_state: {
      companies_processed: 7,
      data_quality_score: 0.992,
      output_location: "build_data/stage_02_processed/dcf_ready/",
      format: "parquet with metadata"
    },
    dependencies: [],
    next_steps: [
      "Load processed financial data for DCF calculations",
      "Apply company-specific valuation assumptions", 
      "Generate DCF models with sensitivity analysis"
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "TSLA has unusual cash flow patterns - recommend manual validation",
      "NVDA growth rates may need custom assumptions due to AI market dynamics"
    ]
  },
  communication_type: "handoff",
  urgency: "medium"
}

// Agent-coordinator routes with full context preservation
Task(quant-research-agent, `IMPLEMENT DCF analysis workflow:

**HANDOFF CONTEXT FROM data-engineer-agent**:
${JSON.stringify(handoff.context, null, 2)}

EXECUTE DCF calculations: Load the processed financial data from ${handoff.context.current_state.output_location}, apply valuation models, handle the specific recommendations for TSLA and NVDA. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION with sensitivity analysis and output generation.

**CRITICAL**: If you encounter issues with the data format or quality, immediately communicate back to data-engineer-agent through agent-coordinator.`)
```

### 2. **Agent Consultation Protocol** (NEW IMPLEMENTATION)

#### **Consultation Request Mechanism**
```typescript
interface AgentConsultation {
  requesting_agent: string;
  expert_agents: string[];
  consultation_topic: string;
  specific_questions: string[];
  current_work_context: object;
  urgency_level: "can_wait" | "blocking" | "critical";
  expected_response_type: "advice" | "review" | "implementation_assistance";
}
```

#### **Example: Backend Architect Consults Security and Performance**
```typescript
// Backend architect needs expert input on API design
const consultation: AgentConsultation = {
  requesting_agent: "backend-architect-agent",
  expert_agents: ["security-engineer-agent", "performance-engineer-agent"],
  consultation_topic: "High-frequency trading API security and performance optimization",
  specific_questions: [
    "What authentication mechanism provides sub-millisecond validation for API calls?",
    "How to implement rate limiting that doesn't create latency bottlenecks?", 
    "Best practices for API token management in high-frequency environments?"
  ],
  current_work_context: {
    api_type: "REST API for trading operations", 
    expected_load: "10,000+ requests/second",
    latency_requirement: "<1ms response time",
    security_requirements: "Financial compliance + PCI DSS"
  },
  urgency_level: "blocking",
  expected_response_type: "implementation_assistance"
}

// Agent-coordinator orchestrates parallel consultation
parallel_consultation([
  Task(security-engineer-agent, `EXPERT CONSULTATION REQUEST from backend-architect-agent:

**Context**: ${consultation.consultation_topic}
**Current Work**: ${JSON.stringify(consultation.current_work_context)}

**Your Expertise Needed On**:
${consultation.specific_questions.filter(q => q.includes('authentication') || q.includes('security')).join('\n')}

PROVIDE implementation recommendations: Analyze the high-frequency trading requirements, recommend specific security mechanisms, provide code examples or configuration templates. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION guidance including specific technical recommendations.`),

  Task(performance-engineer-agent, `EXPERT CONSULTATION REQUEST from backend-architect-agent:

**Context**: ${consultation.consultation_topic}  
**Current Work**: ${JSON.stringify(consultation.current_work_context)}

**Your Expertise Needed On**:
${consultation.specific_questions.filter(q => q.includes('latency') || q.includes('performance')).join('\n')}

PROVIDE implementation recommendations: Analyze the sub-millisecond latency requirements, recommend optimization strategies, provide architectural patterns. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION guidance with benchmarks and performance validation approaches.`)
])
```

### 3. **Collaborative Problem-Solving Protocol** (NEW IMPLEMENTATION)

```typescript
interface CollaborativeProblem {
  problem_id: string;
  problem_description: string;
  affected_domains: string[];
  required_agents: string[];
  collaboration_pattern: "consensus" | "lead_with_advisors" | "parallel_investigation";
  problem_severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "production_critical";
}
```

#### **Example: Production Performance Issue Resolution**
```typescript
const problem: CollaborativeProblem = {
  problem_id: "PERF_2025_09_12_001",
  problem_description: "DCF calculation pipeline experiencing 300% slowdown in production",
  affected_domains: ["data_processing", "financial_analysis", "infrastructure", "monitoring"],
  required_agents: ["monitoring-agent", "performance-engineer-agent", "data-engineer-agent", "quant-research-agent", "infra-ops-agent"],
  collaboration_pattern: "parallel_investigation", 
  problem_severity: "production_critical"
}

// Agent-coordinator orchestrates collaborative investigation
collaborative_investigation([
  // Phase 1: Parallel Investigation (each agent focuses on their domain)
  Task(monitoring-agent, `URGENT PRODUCTION ISSUE INVESTIGATION:

**Problem**: DCF calculation pipeline 300% slowdown

// Phase 2: Results Integration and Solution Coordination
‚Üí await all_investigations_complete  
‚Üí Task(performance-engineer-agent, "EXECUTE collaborative solution integration: Consolidate findings from all agents, identify root cause, create coordinated fix plan. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION with integrated solution approach.")
```

## üîÑ CONTEXT CONTINUITY MECHANISMS

  session_id: string;
  agent_context_store: Map<string, AgentContext>;
  shared_state: object;
  pending_communications: AgentMessage[];
  active_collaborations: string[];
}

// Agents maintain context across task boundaries
function bridgeAgentSession(agent: string, previousContext: AgentContext) {
  return {
    agent_id: agent,
    previous_session_context: previousContext,
    continuation_instructions: `CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS SESSION: ${JSON.stringify(previousContext)}. Continue from where previous session left off.`,
    shared_dependencies: previousContext.dependencies,
    communication_history: previousContext.communications
  }
}
```

### 2. **Working Memory Protocol**
```typescript
interface AgentWorkingMemory {
  current_task_context: object;
  communication_log: AgentMessage[];
  pending_handoffs: AgentHandoff[];
  collaboration_commitments: string[];
  shared_resources: string[];
  escalation_history: string[];
}

// Agents maintain working memory for collaboration
function updateWorkingMemory(agent: string, update: Partial<AgentWorkingMemory>) {
  // Store in gitignored local working memory
  // Accessible by agent-coordinator for orchestration
  // Preserves context across individual task executions
}
```

## üìû COMMUNICATION ROUTING PROTOCOLS

### **Agent-Coordinator Communication Hub**

```typescript
class CommunicationHub {
  // Route inter-agent communications through agent-coordinator
  routeCommunication(from: string, to: string, message: AgentMessage) {
    return Task("agent-coordinator", `FACILITATE INTER-AGENT COMMUNICATION:

**FROM**: ${from}
**TO**: ${to}  
**MESSAGE TYPE**: ${message.type}
**CONTENT**: ${message.content}

EXECUTE communication routing: Ensure ${to} receives context from ${from}, facilitate any needed clarification, monitor for successful handoff. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION of communication facilitation.`);
  }
  
  // Multi-agent broadcast for urgent issues
  broadcastToTeam(agents: string[], message: UrgentMessage) {
    return parallel_execution(
      agents.map(agent => 
        Task(agent, `URGENT TEAM COMMUNICATION: ${message.content}. 
        
Your specific action required: ${message.agent_specific_actions[agent]}. 
        
EXECUTE immediate response: Acknowledge receipt, provide your status, take required action. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION of your response.`)
      )
    );
  }
}
```

## üö® EMERGENCY COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### **Escalation Communication Chain**
```yaml
escalation_patterns:
  # When agent encounters blocking issue
  blocking_issue_escalation:
    step_1: "Report to agent-coordinator with specific blocking details"
    step_2: "Agent-coordinator identifies required expert agents"  
    step_3: "Parallel consultation with experts"
    step_4: "Coordinated solution implementation"
    
  # When multiple agents need urgent coordination  
  urgent_multi_agent_coordination:
    step_1: "Any agent can trigger urgent coordination request"
    step_2: "Agent-coordinator assembles required team"
    step_3: "Parallel urgent assessment with fixed timeline"
    step_4: "Coordinated emergency response execution"
    
  # When agent-agent communication fails
  communication_failure_recovery:
    step_1: "Detecting agent reports communication failure"
    step_2: "Agent-coordinator validates both agents' status"
    step_3: "Restart communication with enhanced context"
    step_4: "Implement backup communication pathway if needed"
```

## üìä COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS MONITORING

### **Communication Success Metrics**
```yaml
success_indicators:
  context_preservation: "Downstream agents successfully use context from upstream agents"
  coordination_efficiency: "Multi-agent tasks complete without rework or blocking issues"
  problem_resolution_speed: "Collaborative problems resolved faster than single-agent attempts"
  handoff_success_rate: "Agent handoffs result in successful task continuation >95%"
  
failure_patterns_to_detect:
  context_loss: "Downstream agent asks for information already provided by upstream agent"
  coordination_breakdown: "Multiple agents working on conflicting solutions"  
  communication_loops: "Agents repeatedly asking same questions without resolution"
  isolation_fallback: "Agents abandoning collaboration and working in isolation"
```
