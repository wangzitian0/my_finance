## Security Error Handling and Resilience Framework

### Authentication Service Reliability
```typescript
class AuthenticationResilienceManager {
  private primaryAuthService: AuthService;
  private fallbackAuthServices: AuthService[];
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;
  private offlineAuthCache: Map<string, CachedCredential>;
  
  async authenticateWithFailover(credentials: AuthCredentials): Promise<AuthResult> {
    try {
      // Primary authentication attempt
      return await this.circuitBreaker.execute(() => 
        this.primaryAuthService.authenticate(credentials)
      );
    } catch (error) {
      this.logAuthenticationError(error, 'primary');
      
      // Fallback to secondary services
      for (const fallbackService of this.fallbackAuthServices) {
        try {
          return await fallbackService.authenticate(credentials);
        } catch (fallbackError) {
          this.logAuthenticationError(fallbackError, 'fallback');
        }
      }
      
      // Final fallback: cached offline authentication (limited time)
      return this.tryOfflineAuthentication(credentials);
    }
  }
  
  private tryOfflineAuthentication(credentials: AuthCredentials): AuthResult {
    const cached = this.offlineAuthCache.get(credentials.username);
    if (cached && !this.isCacheExpired(cached)) {
      this.logSecurityEvent("Offline authentication used", "warning");
      return { success: true, token: cached.token, isOffline: true };
    }
    throw new SecurityError("All authentication services unavailable");
  }
}

    def _try_backup_hsms(self, key_id: str) -> EncryptionKey:
        """Attempt key retrieval from backup HSMs"""
        for backup_hsm in self.backup_hsms:
            try:
                key = backup_hsm.retrieve_key(key_id)
                self.log_warning(f"Key retrieved from backup HSM: {backup_hsm.name}")
                return key
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_error(f"Backup HSM {backup_hsm.name} failed: {e}")
