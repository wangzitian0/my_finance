### Prohibited Documentation Files
- NEVER create .md files for: Architecture reviews, implementation plans, optimization roadmaps, project status
- ALL planning must use GitHub Issues with proper labels and milestones
- Only allowed .md files: README.md, CLAUDE.md, module-specific README.md, API documentation

### P3 Workflow Compliance
**P3 WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE**: Never bypass p3 command system
- **MANDATORY COMMANDS**: `p3 env-status`, `p3 e2e`, `p3 create-pr`
- **TESTING SCOPES**: f2 (dev), m7 (testing), n100 (validation), v3k (production)
- **QUALITY ASSURANCE**: `p3 e2e m7` validation mandatory before PR creation

### Build Data Management
**SSOT COMPLIANCE**: Use DirectoryManager for all path operations
- **CONFIGURATION CENTRALIZATION**: Use `common/config/` for all configurations
- **LOGS**: All logs must go to build_data/logs/
- **ARTIFACTS**: All build outputs must go to build_data/ structure

Always prioritize the highest levels of security appropriate for financial institutions while maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring full regulatory compliance across all quantitative trading operations.
