# Task Delegation: Issue Management Framework Implementation

**Task ID**: 165-Phase1-IssueManagement
**Delegated To**: git-ops-agent
**Supporting Agents**: agent-coordinator
**Priority**: P0-Critical
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

## Task Context

The current issue #165 "Sub-agent system improvement" is too large (3 phases, 21 days) and needs to be broken down using a systematic approach. This task implements the issue management framework to solve this problem and prevent future oversized issues.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Create Issue Breakdown Framework**: Systematic approach to decomposing complex issues
2. **Implement Automation**: GitHub integration for complexity detection and flagging
3. **Apply to Current Problem**: Break down issue #165 immediately using the new framework
4. **Establish Best Practices**: Document and integrate with agent coordination system

## Specific Deliverables

### 1. GitHub Issue Templates
Create templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

**Complex Issue Assessment Template**:
- Complexity indicators checklist
- Estimated duration field
- Agent specialization requirements
- Dependency mapping section

**Parent Issue Template**:
- Overview and strategic context
- Child issues listing with estimates
- Success criteria definition
- Cross-issue coordination plan

**Child Issue Template**:
- Single-focus scope definition
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Parent issue linkage
- Agent assignment guidance

### 2. Issue Complexity Detection
Implement automated system to identify oversized issues:

**Criteria**:
- Duration > 5 days estimated work
- Multiple distinct phases or systems involved
- More than 3 different agent specializations required
- Dependencies that could create blocking scenarios

**Actions**:
- Automatic labeling of complex issues
- Recommendation for breakdown
- Integration with agent-coordinator routing

### 3. Immediate Application: Issue #165 Breakdown
Break down current issue #165 into properly sized child issues:

**Proposed Structure**:
```
Root Issue #165: "Sub-Agent System Enhancement Strategy"
├── Child #165A: "Issue Management Framework Implementation" (2-3 days)
├── Child #165B: "HRBP and RevOps Agent Creation" (2-3 days) 
└── Child #165C: "Agent-Coordinator Optimization" (1-2 days)
```

### 4. Integration and Documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md with issue management guidelines
- Integrate with agent-coordinator delegation system
- Document workflow patterns for multi-issue projects
- Create examples and best practices guide

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### GitHub Integration
- Issue templates with proper markdown formatting
- GitHub Actions for complexity detection (optional)
- Label integration for agent routing system
- Cross-reference automation for parent-child linking

### Agent Coordination Integration
- Update label-to-agent mapping for issue management
- Ensure learning system captures breakdown patterns
- Support for multi-issue task tracking
- Progress reporting across related issues

### Quality Assurance
- Validate that child issues sum to parent scope
- Ensure no scope overlap between children
- Verify dependencies are properly mapped
- Test integration with existing workflows

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (This Phase)
- [ ] Issue #165 broken down into 3 manageable child issues
- [ ] Each child issue estimated at ≤3 days
- [ ] Clear dependencies mapped and documented
- [ ] Agent specializations properly aligned

### System Success (Ongoing)
- [ ] GitHub templates available and functional
- [ ] Automatic complexity detection working
- [ ] Integration with agent-coordinator complete
- [ ] Documentation and best practices published

### Quality Metrics
- Child issue completion rate >95%
- No child issue taking >3 days actual time
- Parent-child dependency conflicts: 0
- Agent assignment accuracy maintained

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: GitHub integration complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with manual templates, automate incrementally

**Risk**: Scope creep in child issues
**Mitigation**: Strict acceptance criteria and regular validation

**Risk**: Agent coordination disruption
**Mitigation**: Maintain existing workflows during transition

## Next Phase Dependencies

This phase creates the foundation for:
- **Phase 2**: Creating properly sized issues for HRBP/RevOps agent implementation
- **Phase 3**: Managing the agent-coordinator refactoring as structured issues

The git-ops-agent must ensure the framework can handle these upcoming complex tasks.
