### Phase 2: Specialized Agent Creation ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 days
**Lead Agent**: `backend-architect-agent`
**Supporting Agents**: `performance-engineer-agent`, `compliance-risk-agent`
**GitHub Issue**: TBD - HRBP and RevOps Agent Implementation

#### 2A: HRBP Agent Design & Implementation
**Specialization**: Human Resources Business Partner for Agent Management

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Agent job model management and optimization
- Take over 10-PR automatic optimization cycle from agent-coordinator
- Agent performance evaluation and career development
- Resource allocation and workload balancing
- Agent interaction pattern optimization

**Key Capabilities**:
- Parse learning reports from GitHub issue comments
- Analyze agent performance trends over 10-PR cycles
- Generate agent improvement recommendations
- Manage agent specialization evolution
- Coordinate agent training and capability updates

#### 2B: RevOps Agent Design & Implementation  
**Specialization**: Revenue Operations - Cost Optimization and Efficiency

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Cost estimation for computational resources and time
- Monitor resource utilization and optimization opportunities
- Request performance data from monitoring-agent
- Focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency
- Budget planning and resource forecasting

**Key Capabilities**:

### Phase 3: Agent-Coordinator Streamlining ‚è±Ô∏è 1-2 days
**Lead Agent**: `dev-quality-agent`
**Supporting Agents**: `git-ops-agent`, `agent-coordinator`
**GitHub Issue**: TBD - Agent-Coordinator Optimization and Refactoring

**Optimization Objectives**:
- Reduce agent-coordinator.md file size by 40-50%
- Focus on pure process flow and task delegation
- Extract specialized evaluations to appropriate agents
- Maintain all functionality while improving clarity

**Refactoring Strategy**:
1. **Extract to HRBP Agent**: 10-PR optimization cycles, agent evaluation
2. **Extract to RevOps Agent**: Cost analysis, resource optimization
3. **Retain in Agent-Coordinator**: Core delegation logic, workflow patterns
4. **Move to New Files**: Detailed workflow examples, reference patterns

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Streamlined agent-coordinator.md (focus on delegation)
- [ ] Workflow patterns extracted to reference files
- [ ] Agent evaluation moved to HRBP agent
- [ ] Cost optimization moved to RevOps agent
- [ ] Validation that all functionality preserved

**Success Criteria**:
- agent-coordinator.md reduced to <300 lines
- All delegation functionality preserved
- Specialized agents handling appropriate concerns
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Performance maintained or improved

## üîÑ Integration and Validation

### Cross-Phase Dependencies
- Phase 1 informs issue creation for Phases 2 & 3
- Phase 2 agents must be ready before Phase 3 delegation changes
- Phase 3 requires testing with new agents from Phase 2

### Testing Strategy
- Each phase includes comprehensive testing
- Integration testing after all phases complete  
- Validation of learning system continuity
- Performance benchmarking before/after changes

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backup of current agent-coordinator.md
- Incremental deployment of new agents
- Rollback procedures for each phase
- Continuous monitoring during transition

## üìä Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Issue breakdown time: <2 hours for complex issues
- Agent-coordinator.md size: Reduced by 40-50%
- Task delegation accuracy: Maintained >95%
- System performance: No degradation in response time

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved clarity of agent responsibilities
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced system maintainability
- Streamlined developer experience

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create GitHub issues for each phase
2. **Phase 1 Start**: Begin issue management framework implementation
3. **Parallel Planning**: Design specifications for HRBP and RevOps agents
4. **Integration Preparation**: Plan agent-coordinator refactoring approach
