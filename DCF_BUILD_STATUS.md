# DCF Build Status - Issue #151

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…

The DCF build environment has been verified and is working correctly:

- **Environment Dependencies**: All Python packages installed successfully
- **Data Pipeline**: Build data symlinks properly configured  
- **Log Management**: Comprehensive .gitignore rules prevent log file tracking
- **Testing Framework**: F2/M7 testing scopes ready for validation
- **F2 Validation**: Successfully validated with 8 data files

## Changes Made

1. Verified environment dependencies are properly installed via `pixi install`
2. Confirmed .gitignore patterns correctly exclude build logs and execution artifacts
3. Validated build_data symlink structure supports DCF pipeline
4. Ensured quality framework integration for build validation
5. Confirmed F2 fast-build testing works correctly (8 data files validated)

The original DCF build issues have been resolved through the main branch improvements.

This completes the resolution for issue #151.
