✅ build_data/
├── stage_00_raw/          # <1000ms - Raw SEC, YFinance data
├── stage_01_daily_delta/  # <500ms  - Incremental processing  
├── stage_02_daily_index/  # <200ms  - Vector embeddings, relationships
├── stage_03_graph_rag/    # <100ms  - Knowledge graph queries ⭐
└── stage_04_query_results/ # <50ms   - Reports, analytics ⭐
```
**Status**: ✅ Complete implementation with performance targets ready

### 2. SSOT Directory Management
```python
# BEFORE (problematic):
data_path = "data/stage_00_original/sec-edgar" 

# AFTER (excellent):
from common import get_source_path, DataLayer
data_path = get_source_path("sec-edgar", DataLayer.RAW_DATA)
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented across P3 CLI and Graph RAG systems

### 3. Storage Backend Abstraction
```python
# Cloud-ready architecture:
storage = StorageManager(StorageBackend.AWS_S3, config)
storage.write_json("reports/analysis.json", data)
```
**Status**: ✅ Framework complete, ready for AWS/GCP/Azure deployment

### 4. Orthogonal Configuration System
```python
# Dynamic runtime configuration:
config = orthogonal_config.build_runtime_config(
    stock_list='n100',              # 101 companies
    data_sources=['sec_edgar'],     # SEC filings
    scenario='production'           # Production settings
)
```
**Status**: ✅ Complete with N100 (101) and V3K (3,485) company support

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability Validation

### Response Time Targets (Issue #122)
