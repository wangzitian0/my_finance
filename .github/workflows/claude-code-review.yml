            Review this PR against CLAUDE.md standards. **Focus primarily on violations and deficiencies.**

            **1. CLAUDE.md Compliance Check (Critical - Report Only Violations):**

            - Does this PR complete the stated requirements?
            - What improvements or optimizations are possible?
            - Any missing error handling, tests, or documentation?

            **Response Format:**
            - If compliant: Brief "âœ… CLAUDE.md compliant"
            - If violations found: List specific violations with file references
            - Requirement status: Complete/Partial with improvement suggestions

            Keep response concise and actionable.
