# Issue: Comprehensive Project Architecture Review and Reorganization

## Problem Statement

The current SEC Filing-Enhanced Graph RAG-powered DCF valuation system requires comprehensive architecture review and directory reorganization. Analysis reveals significant misalignment between actual directory structure and architectural design principles, with numerous organizational issues affecting maintainability and clarity.

## Requirements Analysis

### Current Architecture Assessment
- **Project Scale**: Multi-module quantitative trading platform with RAG system
- **Core Modules**: ETL, dcf_engine, graph_rag, common, infra, evaluation
- **Data Architecture**: Five-layer system (Stage 0-4) with some legacy inconsistencies
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Neo4j, RAG pipeline, SEC Edgar integration

### Identified Problems
1. **Directory Organization Issues**: Mixed legacy and modern patterns across modules
2. **Architectural Boundaries**: Unclear service boundaries and cross-module dependencies  
3. **Configuration Architecture**: Some scattered configs despite recent common/ refactoring
4. **Documentation Hierarchy**: README structure lacks architectural guidance
5. **Clean Structure Gaps**: Some directories don't follow "clean, simple, organized" principle

## Architecture Review Scope

### 1. Comprehensive Directory Structure Audit
- **Primary Directory Analysis**: All top-level directories and their architectural alignment
  - ETL/ - Data processing pipeline architecture compliance
  - dcf_engine/ - DCF calculation service boundaries
  - graph_rag/ - RAG system architectural patterns
  - common/ - Configuration and shared services architecture
  - infra/ - Infrastructure-as-code alignment
  - build_data/ - Data layer architecture compliance
- **Secondary Directory Analysis**: Subdirectory organization and internal structure
- **Cross-Module Dependencies**: Architectural dependency mapping and optimization

### 2. Backend-Architect-Agent Design Compliance
- **RAG System Architecture**: Verify semantic retrieval layer follows architectural patterns
- **Distributed Systems Design**: Ensure microservices boundaries are properly defined
- **Database Architecture**: Validate multi-modal database design (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Vector DB)
- **Service Architecture**: Confirm proper domain boundaries and communication patterns
- **Integration Architecture**: Review external API integration and data synchronization

### 3. Five-Layer Data Architecture Alignment
- **Stage 0 (Raw Data)**: Verify raw data storage follows architectural patterns
- **Stage 1 (Daily Delta)**: Confirm incremental processing architecture
- **Stage 2 (Daily Index)**: Validate indexing and optimization patterns
- **Stage 3 (Graph RAG)**: Ensure RAG pipeline architectural compliance
- **Stage 4 (Query Results)**: Verify results layer follows architectural design
