# CLAUDE.md - Global Company Policies

## üö® MANDATORY TASK INITIATION PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)

**BEFORE ANY TASK EXECUTION - COMPLETE THIS CHECKLIST:**

### Phase 1: Foundation Knowledge ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Read CLAUDE.md completely** (this file) - understand all company policies  
- [ ] **Read README.md** - understand project architecture and setup
- [ ] **Identify task complexity** - single-step vs multi-step vs multi-domain
- [ ] **Think as en engineer** Think about the correct repair method and follow the reuse philosophy of large-scale projects. Avoid bypassing all existing logic and creating a new logic block.
- [ ] **Respect to the basic process**  Avoid skipping or modifying the basic process when it fails.
- [ ] **NEVER BYPASS P3 SHIP FAILURES** When p3 ship fails, ALWAYS fix the root cause. Never create workarounds, mock tests, or manual processes to bypass validation. If pandas import fails, fix the dependency chain. If tests timeout, fix the environment. If validation fails, fix the code. This ensures system integrity and prevents technical debt.
- [ ] **Two-layer modularity** - Before you start, think clearly about what directory to put your code in. The logic you care about should be in the directories/subdirectories/<here>. Follow the two-tier principle of modules/submodules/<file>.


### Phase 2: Tool & Agent Selection ‚úÖ  
- [ ] **Determine tool requirements**:
  - Simple read/analysis ‚Üí Direct tools (Read, Grep, Glob)
  - Git operations ‚Üí Use `p3` commands (NEVER direct git for PR creation)
  - Complex workflows ‚Üí Route through `agent-coordinator`
- [ ] **Select appropriate specialist agents** from 17 available:
  - Orchestration: agent-coordinator
  - Core Ops: git-ops, dev-quality, data-engineer, infra-ops, monitoring  
  - Specialized: quant-research, compliance-risk, backend-architect, web-frontend, web-backend, api-designer, security-engineer, performance-engineer, database-admin
  - Strategic: hrbp, revops

### Phase 3: Workflow Validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Confirm routing decision**:
  - Direct execution: Only for single-step read operations
  - Agent-coordinator: All complex, multi-step, or multi-domain tasks
  - P3 commands: All PR creation (`p3 ship "title" ISSUE_NUM`)
- [ ] **Validate execution keywords** for agent tasks:
  - Use "EXECUTE", "IMPLEMENT", "WRITE CODE" for action
  - End with "COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION"

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Pre-execution checks**:
  - Issue linked and properly scoped (‚â§5 days)
  - GitHub issue exists for context preservation
  - Agent issue tracking confirmed (each agent ‚Üí specific GitHub issue)
- [ ] **Compliance verification**:
  - English-only standard maintained
  - Configuration centralization (`common/config/`)  
  - Documentation currency planned

### Phase 5: Completion & PR Creation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Task completion verification**:
  - All implementation work finished
  - Code tested and validated
  - Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] **Self-validation of design goals** (MANDATORY before PR):
  - Execute validation commands to verify changes work as intended
  - Check compliance with original requirements
  - Validate no regressions introduced
  - Confirm architectural integrity maintained
- [ ] **Automatic PR creation** (MANDATORY for significant changes):
  - Route directly to `git-ops-agent` with EXECUTE keywords
  - Use `p3 ship "title" ISSUE_NUM` workflow
  - Include comprehensive change description
  - Add proper labels and milestone assignment

---

**‚ùå TASK EXECUTION WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS CHECKLIST VIOLATES COMPANY POLICY**

**üéØ QUICK REFERENCE - MOST COMMON VIOLATIONS:**
- Creating PRs with `gh pr create` instead of `p3 ship`
- Routing PR creation through agent-coordinator instead of directly to git-ops-agent
- Using direct tools for complex multi-step tasks instead of agent-coordinator
- Skipping README.md reading before architecture tasks
- Creating .md planning files instead of using GitHub Issues

<!-- Company Policy Document for SEC Filing-Enhanced Quantitative Trading Platform -->

> **Clean Repository Structure** (2025-08-26): Main repository contains only code, documentation, and configurations. Data subtree at `build_data/` with centralized configs at `common/config/`.

This file establishes the global company policies and standards for all Claude Code operations on this SEC Filing-Enhanced Graph RAG-powered DCF valuation system.

## üè¢ COMPANY GOVERNANCE POLICIES

### Universal Entry Point Policy

**CRITICAL**: ALL complex tasks MUST route through agent-coordinator for optimal resource allocation and quality assurance.

#### Core Delegation Principle
- **Agent-Coordinator**: Primary orchestration agent for all multi-step workflows
- **Direct Tools**: Only for simple, single-step operations (file reads, status checks)
- **Specialized Agents**: Selected by agent-coordinator based on task requirements

#### Task Classification Standards

**MANDATORY AGENT-COORDINATOR ROUTING**:
```yaml
ALWAYS_use_agent_coordinator:
  # Git Operations (NEVER use direct tools)
  - ALL git commands (status, diff, log, add, commit, push, rebase)
  - Branch operations and merging
  - Release coordination and tagging
  
  # Exception: PR creation routes DIRECTLY to git-ops-agent (their specialty)
  
  # Development Workflows (NEVER do directly)
  - Code implementation (writing, editing code files)
  - Multi-file refactoring and restructuring
  - Testing and validation workflows
  - Build and deployment processes
  
  # Complex Analysis Tasks
  - Multi-file code analysis and search
  - Architecture planning and system design
  - Data processing and ETL operations
  - Performance analysis and optimization
  
  # Infrastructure Operations  
  - Environment setup and configuration
  - System monitoring and diagnostics
  - Quality assurance processes
  - Documentation generation
  - P3 CLI maintenance and development
```

**DIRECT TOOL USAGE ONLY**:
```yaml
simple_single_step_only:
  # File Operations (READ-ONLY information gathering)
  - Reading single files for information
  - Directory listing for exploration
  - File pattern searching (Glob, Grep) for analysis
  - Simple configuration lookups
  
  # Status and Information Commands
  - Quick system status checks (non-git)
  - Environment variable checks
  - Simple path validation
  
  # NOTE: If any task involves WRITING, MODIFYING, or EXECUTING 
  # multiple steps, it MUST go through agent-coordinator
```

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: When in doubt, route through agent-coordinator. Direct tools are ONLY for read-only information gathering and simple status checks.

#### PR Creation Routing Exception

**CRITICAL PR CREATION POLICY**: PR creation tasks route DIRECTLY to git-ops-agent, NOT through agent-coordinator.

**RATIONALE**: PR creation is git-ops-agent's core specialty and primary responsibility. Direct routing ensures:
- Optimal expertise utilization for git workflows
- Faster PR creation without orchestration overhead  
- Clear accountability for PR quality and compliance
- Specialized handling of `p3 ship` workflow integration

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Direct routing to git-ops-agent for PR creation
Task(subagent_type="git-ops-agent", prompt="EXECUTE PR creation workflow: analyze current branch changes, create comprehensive PR description, submit PR with proper labels and reviewers. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION.")

# ‚ùå WRONG: Routing PR creation through agent-coordinator
Task(subagent_type="agent-coordinator", prompt="Create PR for current changes")
```

#### Claude Code Operation Matrix

| Operation Type | Tool Usage | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Git Commands** | üö´ NEVER Direct ‚Üí ‚úÖ agent-coordinator | `git status` ‚Üí Task(agent-coordinator) |
| **Code Writing** | üö´ NEVER Direct ‚Üí ‚úÖ agent-coordinator | Writing functions ‚Üí Task(backend-architect-agent) |
| **Multi-file Edit** | üö´ NEVER Direct ‚Üí ‚úÖ agent-coordinator | Refactoring ‚Üí Task(dev-quality-agent) |
| **PR Creation** | üö´ NEVER Direct ‚Üí ‚úÖ git-ops-agent | `p3 ship` ‚Üí Task(git-ops-agent) |
| **File Reading** | ‚úÖ Direct Tools OK | Read("path/file.py") |
| **Directory Listing** | ‚úÖ Direct Tools OK | LS("/path/to/dir") |
| **Pattern Search** | ‚úÖ Direct Tools OK | Grep("pattern", glob="*.py") |
| **Status Check** | ‚úÖ Direct Tools OK | Non-git status commands |

#### Violation Examples to Avoid
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG: Direct git commands
Bash("git status")
Bash("git add .")
Bash("git commit -m 'message'")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Route through agent-coordinator with EXECUTION instructions
Task(subagent_type="agent-coordinator", prompt="EXECUTE git commit workflow: analyze current changes with git status and git diff, add all modified files, create commit with descriptive message, and push to remote. WRITE CODE and COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION.")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: For PR creation, route DIRECTLY to git-ops-agent  
Task(subagent_type="git-ops-agent", prompt="EXECUTE PR creation workflow: analyze current branch changes, create comprehensive PR description, submit PR with proper labels and reviewers. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION.")
```

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Direct code implementation  
Write("/path/file.py", "def new_function()...")
Edit("/path/file.py", old="...", new="...")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Route through agent-coordinator with EXECUTION instructions
Task(subagent_type="agent-coordinator", prompt="IMPLEMENT new function in file.py: WRITE CODE to create the function, add proper error handling, update tests, and validate functionality. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION, do not just provide a plan.")
```

#### Critical Execution Instructions for Sub-Agents

**üö® MANDATORY EXECUTION KEYWORDS**: Always include these in Task prompts to ensure execution rather than planning:

```yaml
EXECUTION_REQUIRED_KEYWORDS:
  # Primary Action Directives (MUST include one)
  - "EXECUTE": For operational tasks (git, builds, deployments)
  - "IMPLEMENT": For code writing and development tasks  
  - "WRITE CODE": For programming tasks requiring file creation/modification
  - "COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION": End all prompts with this phrase

  # Clarity Modifiers (include when applicable)
  - "do not just provide a plan": Explicitly prevent planning-only responses
  - "write actual code": Distinguish from analysis tasks
  - "complete all steps": Ensure full workflow execution
  - "validate and test": Include verification steps

RESEARCH_ONLY_KEYWORDS:
  # Use these ONLY when you want analysis without execution
  - "ANALYZE": For code review and investigation
  - "RESEARCH": For information gathering
  - "STUDY": For understanding existing systems
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT Task Prompt Structure**:
```python
# Full execution pattern
Task(subagent_type="[agent-type]", prompt="[ACTION_VERB] [specific_task]: [detailed_requirements]. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION, do not just provide a plan.")

# Examples that WORK:
Task(subagent_type="git-ops-agent", prompt="EXECUTE PR creation workflow: analyze current branch changes, create comprehensive PR description, submit PR with proper labels and reviewers. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION.")

Task(subagent_type="backend-architect-agent", prompt="IMPLEMENT user authentication system: WRITE CODE for login endpoints, add JWT token handling, create middleware, update database models. COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION, do not just provide a plan.")

Task(subagent_type="data-engineer-agent", prompt="EXECUTE ETL pipeline setup: configure data ingestion from SEC filings, implement processing logic, setup output validation. WRITE CODE and COMPLETE THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION.")
```

**‚ùå WRONG Task Prompts That Cause Planning-Only Responses**:
```python
# These cause agents to stop at planning phase:
Task(subagent_type="agent-coordinator", prompt="Handle git commit for changes")
Task(subagent_type="backend-architect-agent", prompt="Implement new function in file.py") 
Task(subagent_type="data-engineer-agent", prompt="Setup ETL pipeline")
```

## üè∑Ô∏è AGENT SPECIALIZATION DIRECTORY

```

**ESCALATION PROTOCOLS FOR P3 ISSUES**:
1. **Technical Issues**: Report directly to infra-ops-agent
2. **Policy Violations**: Report to hrbp-agent for compliance tracking
3. **Workflow Integration**: Route through agent-coordinator for analysis
4. **Performance Issues**: Monitor via monitoring-agent, escalate to infra-ops-agent

## üß† CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MANDATE

### Company Learning Policy
**REQUIREMENT**: All task execution must contribute to organizational learning and system optimization.

**Implementation**: Agent-coordinator manages all learning workflows, issue breakdown analysis, and optimization cycles. Detailed procedures are defined in agent-coordinator specifications.

### Performance Optimization Schedule
**POLICY**: System-wide optimization occurs every 10 PRs automatically
**SCOPE**: Agent performance analysis, workflow efficiency, and capability enhancement
**EXECUTION**: Agent-coordinator triggers and manages optimization cycles

## üö® NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPANY STANDARDS

1. **ARCHITECTURE FIRST** - Always read README.md before starting any task
2. **ORCHESTRATION MANDATORY** - Route complex tasks through agent-coordinator 
3. **SSOT I/O ENFORCEMENT** - Only use `common.core.directory_manager` for ALL file operations (see `common/README.md`)
4. **CONFIGURATION CENTRALIZATION** - Use `common/config/` for all configurations
5. **P3 WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE** - Never bypass p3 command system
6. **QUALITY ASSURANCE** - Test before PR creation (`p3 test` mandatory)
7. **AUTOMATIC PR CREATION** - Always create PR after completing significant changes via `git-ops-agent`
8. **DOCUMENTATION CURRENCY** - Update parent READMEs when modifying functionality  
9. **ENGLISH-ONLY STANDARD** - All technical content must use English
10. **OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE** - Monitor and handle system errors appropriately
11. **PROJECT MANAGEMENT** - Break down oversized issues (>5 days) before execution

## üìã PROJECT MANAGEMENT STANDARDS

### Issue Scope Policy
**REQUIREMENT**: All issues must be properly scoped (‚â§5 days) before execution
**ENFORCEMENT**: Agent-coordinator evaluates and decomposes oversized issues
**STANDARDS**: Single domain focus, clear dependencies, measurable outcomes

### GitHub Integration Requirements
**POLICY**: All development work must link to GitHub issues for traceability
**LABELING**: Use standardized labels that map to agent specializations
**TRACKING**: Maintain issue dependency relationships and progress visibility

### Agent Persistence Principle
**CRITICAL**: Each agent must maintain context and continuity through a structured persistence hierarchy.

#### Agent Context Management
```yaml
PERSISTENCE_HIERARCHY:
  # Long-term Objectives (Agent Description Files)
  - Agent capabilities and specializations
  - Core responsibilities and scope
  - Interface specifications and protocols
  - Permanent configuration and settings
  
  # Medium-term Goals (GitHub Issues)  
  - Current development objectives
  - Performance improvement targets
  - Integration milestones and dependencies
  - Context preservation across sessions
  
  # Short-term Work (Local, Gitignored)
  - Session-specific execution state
  - Temporary debugging information
  - Runtime logs and diagnostics
  - Transient workflow data
```

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- Every agent description file MUST link to its corresponding GitHub issue for context preservation
- Agent issues serve as persistent memory for medium-term objectives and session continuity
- Local work stays ephemeral and is automatically gitignored

### Documentation and Planning Policy
**CRITICAL**: Use GitHub Issues for ALL planning and documentation, NOT additional .md files

#### Planning Management Rules
```yaml
ALWAYS_use_github_issues:
  # Project Planning (NEVER create .md files)
  - Architecture planning and design documents
  - Implementation roadmaps and phase planning  
  - Task breakdown and dependency tracking
  - Progress reports and status updates
  - Review findings and recommendations
  - Optimization plans and strategies

PROHIBITED_documentation_files:
  - ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md  
  - OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md
  - PROJECT_STATUS.md
  - Any planning or tracking .md files

ALLOWED_documentation_only:
  - README.md (project overview and setup)
  - CLAUDE.md (global company policies)
  - Module-specific README.md (technical documentation)
  - API documentation (when required)
```

**ENFORCEMENT**: All planning, tracking, and architectural documentation MUST be managed through GitHub Issues with proper labels, milestones, and cross-references. Never create additional .md files for project management.

## üö® POLICY COMPLIANCE MONITORING

### HRBP-Managed Violation Tracking System
**IMPLEMENTATION**: GitHub issues labeled "policy-violation" managed by HRBP agent
**ESCALATION**: Repeated violations trigger HRBP intervention and remediation protocols
**REMEDIATION**: Mandatory agent retraining, documentation updates, and process improvements

### Common Violations to Monitor
**CRITICAL POLICY VIOLATIONS**:
- **PR Creation Bypass**: Using `gh pr create` instead of mandatory `p3 ship`
- **PR Creation Routing Error**: Routing PR creation through agent-coordinator instead of directly to git-ops-agent
- **Agent-Coordinator Bypass**: Using direct tools for complex multi-step tasks
- **Policy Reading Failure**: Skipping mandatory task initiation protocol checklist
- **GitHub Issue Avoidance**: Creating .md planning files instead of using GitHub issues
- **P3 Workflow Non-Compliance**: Bypassing required testing and validation steps
- **P3 CLI Unauthorized Modification**: Modifying P3 CLI without infra-ops-agent approval

### Violation Response Protocol
```yaml
violation_severity:
  level_1_warning:
    - First-time policy bypass
    - Immediate correction with documentation reference
    - HRBP notification for tracking
    
  level_2_intervention:
    - Repeated violations (2+ instances)
    - HRBP-mandated policy review session
    - GitHub issue creation for violation tracking
    
  level_3_remediation:
    - Persistent non-compliance (3+ instances)
    - Formal HRBP assessment and retraining
    - Agent definition file review and updates
    - Management escalation consideration
```

### Performance Metrics and Tracking
**HRBP MONITORING RESPONSIBILITIES**:
- Weekly policy compliance rate analysis
- Violation pattern identification and root cause analysis
- Agent-specific compliance tracking and improvement planning
- Quarterly compliance reporting and policy optimization recommendations

## üõ°Ô∏è OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE POLICY

### Error Management Standards
**REQUIREMENT**: All system errors must be handled gracefully with appropriate fallback mechanisms
**IMPLEMENTATION**: Agent-coordinator manages error detection, recovery protocols, and system resilience
**MONITORING**: Continuous error pattern analysis and system optimization

### Agent Availability Management  
**CURRENT STATUS**: Limited agent implementation requires robust fallback strategies
**POLICY**: All delegations must include fallback routing when primary agents unavailable
**EVOLUTION**: Agent ecosystem will expand based on usage patterns and business needs

## üõ†Ô∏è UNIFIED I/O CONSTRAINTS

**CRITICAL**: All file I/O operations must use the SSOT DirectoryManager system exclusively. No exceptions.

**ENFORCEMENT**: All PR creation must pass I/O compliance checks. Any non-SSOT I/O patterns will block PR approval.

**üìñ DETAILED RULES**: See `common/README.md` for complete I/O standards, violation levels, migration guide, and compliance validation procedures.

### Quick Reference

#### ‚úÖ REQUIRED Pattern
```python
from common.core.directory_manager import directory_manager, DataLayer
data_path = directory_manager.get_layer_path(DataLayer.RAW_DATA, partition="20250901")
```

#### ‚ùå PROHIBITED Patterns
```python
data_path = Path("build_data/stage_00_raw/20250901")  # FORBIDDEN
from common.io_utils import load_json                 # REMOVED
```

#### Validation Command
```bash
bash scripts/config/validate_io_compliance.sh  # Run before PR creation
```

## üåê ENGLISH-ONLY STANDARD

**CRITICAL**: All technical content must use English for international standards compliance.

### Mandatory English Usage
- **Code**: Variables, functions, classes, modules
- **Documentation**: Comments, docstrings, README files  
- **Configuration**: Config keys, values, documentation
- **Operations**: Log messages, error messages, commit messages
- **Communication**: Issue tracking, PR descriptions, technical discussions

### Exception Policy
**Acceptable Non-English**: User-facing templates for localization (in dedicated i18n directories only)

## ‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE STANDARDS

### Configuration Management
**CENTRALIZATION**: All configurations at `common/config/` for SSOT compliance
**DIRECTORY PATHS**: Use centralized `directory_manager` - never hard-code paths
**DATA LAYERS**: Use DataLayer enums instead of string paths

### Command System Compliance  
**P3 WORKFLOW**: Always use `p3 <command> [scope]` - never direct python scripts
**TESTING SCOPES**: f2 (dev), m7 (testing), n100 (validation), v3k (production)
**MANDATORY COMMANDS**: `p3 ready`, `p3 test`, `p3 ship`
**P3 CLI MAINTENANCE**: All P3 CLI modifications must route through infra-ops-agent

#### P3 Workflow Decision Matrix

**üéØ "What do I want to do?" ‚Üí Command Selection Guide**

| What You Want | Command | When to Use |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **"Start working"** | `p3 ready` | Beginning of work session, after restart, uncertain environment |
| **"Check my code"** | `p3 check [scope]` | After changes, before commit, during development (use `f2` for speed) |
| **"Test everything"** | `p3 test [scope]` | Before PR (F2 mandatory), after architectural changes, final validation |
| **"Create PR"** | `p3 ship "title" issue` | Work complete, tested, ready for review (F2 tests must pass) |
| **"What's wrong?"** | `p3 debug` | Tests failing, environment issues, services not responding |
| **"Fix everything"** | `p3 reset` | Multiple failures, corruption, last resort (‚ö†Ô∏è destructive) |
| **"Build datasets"** | `p3 build [scope]` | Data pipeline testing, analysis prep, production data generation |
| **"Show version"** | `p3 version` | Debugging version issues, documentation, system verification |

**Scope Guidelines**:
- **f2** (2 companies, 2-5min): Development default, PR validation
- **m7** (7 companies, 10-20min): Release prep, integration testing
- **n100** (100 companies, 1-3hr): Production validation, performance testing
- **v3k** (3000+ companies, 6-12hr): Full production datasets only

**üö® MANDATORY P3 USAGE PATTERNS**:

```yaml
REQUIRED_WORKFLOWS:
  daily_start:
    sequence: ["p3 ready"]
    frequency: "Every work session start"
    
  development_cycle:
    sequence: ["p3 check f2", "make changes", "p3 check f2", "repeat"]
    frequency: "During active development"
    
  pr_creation:
    sequence: ["p3 test f2", "p3 ship 'Title' ISSUE_NUM"]
    frequency: "When work is complete"
    requirements: "F2 tests MUST pass"
    
  emergency_recovery:
    sequence: ["p3 debug", "attempt fixes", "p3 reset if needed", "p3 ready"]
    frequency: "When systems fail"

PROHIBITED_PATTERNS:
  # NEVER bypass P3 system
  - Direct git commands for PR creation
  - Direct python script execution  
  - Manual environment setup
  - Skip testing before PR (F2 minimum mandatory)
  - Use old testing options (--skip-m7-test removed)
```

    use_cases:
      - Development testing (mandatory before PR)
      - Quick code validation
      - Rapid feedback cycles
      - CI/CD validation
    when: "Default choice for most development work"
    
  m7_medium_scope:
    companies: 7
    duration: "10-20 minutes"  
    use_cases:
      - Pre-release validation
      - Integration testing
      - Performance baseline
      - Regression testing
    when: "Before major releases or architectural changes"
    
  n100_large_scope:
    companies: 100
    duration: "1-3 hours"
    use_cases:
      - Production validation
      - Performance testing
      - Data quality validation
      - Release candidate testing
    when: "Release preparation and production readiness"
    
  v3k_production_scope:
    companies: "3000+"
    duration: "6-12 hours"
    use_cases:
      - Full production datasets
      - Complete system validation
      - Production deployment
      - Final release validation
    when: "Production deployment only"

DEFAULT_RECOMMENDATIONS:
  development: "Always use f2 for development work"
  testing: "Use f2 for PR validation, m7 for release prep"
  production: "Use n100 for staging, v3k for production"
```

### Quality Assurance Requirements
**PRE-PR TESTING**: `p3 test m7` validation mandatory before PR creation
**README CONSISTENCY**: Update parent READMEs when modifying directory functionality
**ISSUE LINKING**: All changes must link to GitHub issues for traceability
