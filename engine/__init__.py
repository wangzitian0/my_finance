strategies and reports using Graph-RAG and LLM integration.

Business Logic Flow:
Neo4j Knowledge Graph + LLM + Templates â†’ Investment Strategies & Reports

This module represents the heart of the investment analysis system, taking
processed data from ETL pipelines and Neo4j graphs and generating actionable
investment insights.

Components:
- retrieval/: Graph-enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (professional terminology)
- reasoning/: Language model integration and prompt management (professional terminology)
- valuation/: Investment strategy generation (DCF calculations, valuation models) (professional terminology)
- reporting/: Investment report generation and formatting (professional terminology)

Issue #256: Consolidates graph-RAG functionality from analysis/ and creates
clear business separation between data processing (ETL) and reasoning (engine).
