# Graph RAG Compatibility Note

The Graph RAG system has dependency compatibility issues with the current environment:

## Issues Identified:
1. NumPy 2.x vs 1.x compatibility with sentence-transformers
2. torch.uint64 attribute missing in current torch version  
3. safetensors version compatibility

## Recommended Solutions:
1. Use conda environment with pinned versions
2. Consider using Docker for Graph RAG components
3. Update to newer versions of all ML dependencies simultaneously

## Current Status:
- M7 data collection: ✅ Working
- Basic data analysis: ✅ Working  
- Graph RAG system: ⚠️ Needs dependency fixes

## Next Steps:
- Focus on DCF calculation engine development
- Address Graph RAG dependencies in dedicated ML environment
- Create separate pixi environment for ML workloads
