# Development Utilities - Tools and Diagnostics

Essential development tools, environment validation utilities, and system diagnostics supporting daily development workflows.

## Overview

This directory provides the foundational utilities that support development activities, environment management, and system troubleshooting. These tools are designed for direct developer use and integration with automated workflows.

## Core Utilities

### Environment Validation
- **`fast_env_check.py`** - 5-second environment health check with parallel validation
- **Service status checking**: Podman machine, Neo4j web interface, Python environment
- **Dependency validation**: Package availability, import testing
- **Quick diagnostics**: Fast fail detection with clear error messages

### Development Helpers
- **Code quality tools**: Integration helpers for formatting, linting, testing
- **Debugging utilities**: Environment introspection, configuration validation
- **Development workflow support**: Session management, state tracking

### System Diagnostics
- **Performance monitoring**: Resource usage tracking, bottleneck identification
- **Troubleshooting tools**: Comprehensive system analysis, issue resolution
- **Configuration validation**: Settings verification, environment consistency

## Key Features

### 1. Fast Environment Validation (`fast_env_check.py`)
**5-second comprehensive environment health check**:
```python
# Parallel service validation with 2-second individual timeouts
‚úÖ Podman Machine: Currently running  
‚úÖ Neo4j Web: Interface responding on localhost:7474
‚úÖ Environment ready for development
```

**Features**:
- **Parallel execution**: All checks run simultaneously for speed
- **Timeout protection**: Individual 2s timeouts, 5s total maximum
- **Clear diagnostics**: Specific error messages with fix suggestions
- **Integration ready**: Used by PR workflows for pre-flight validation

### 2. Service Health Monitoring
**Critical service status checking**:
- **Podman Machine**: Container runtime availability and status
- **Neo4j Database**: Web interface and bolt connection health
- **Python Environment**: Package availability and import testing
- **Development Services**: Additional tool availability checking

### 3. Development Workflow Integration
**Tools supporting daily development**:
- **Pre-commit validation**: Environment readiness before code changes
- **PR preparation**: Environment validation before PR creation
- **Troubleshooting**: Quick problem identification and resolution
- **Session management**: Development session state tracking

## Utility Categories

### Environment Validation Tools
Tools for checking development environment health:
- Service availability checking (Podman, Neo4j, databases)
- Dependency validation (Python packages, system tools)
- Configuration verification (settings, paths, credentials)
- Performance monitoring (resource usage, response times)

### Development Support Tools
Tools supporting daily development activities:
- Code quality helpers (formatting, linting integration)
- Debugging utilities (environment introspection, logging)
- Session management (state tracking, workflow context)
- Configuration management (settings validation, environment setup)

### System Diagnostic Tools
Tools for troubleshooting and system analysis:
- Comprehensive system health checks
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- Error pattern analysis and resolution suggestions
- Service dependency mapping and validation

### Integration Utilities
Tools supporting integration with other system components:
- P3 workflow integration helpers
- CI/CD pipeline utilities
- Infrastructure automation support
- Testing framework integration

## Usage Examples

### Daily Development Validation
```bash
# Quick environment check before starting work
python scripts/utilities/fast_env_check.py

# Expected output:
üöÄ Fast Environment Check (5s timeout)
‚úÖ Podman Machine: Currently running
‚úÖ Neo4j Web: Interface responding
‚úÖ All checks passed! Environment ready.
```

### Troubleshooting Environment Issues
```bash
# When environment issues are detected:
‚ùå Neo4j Web: Not responding on localhost:7474
üîß Quick fixes:
   ‚Ä¢ Run: ansible-playbook infra/ansible/start.yml
   
# After fixing:
‚úÖ Neo4j Web: Interface responding
‚úÖ All checks passed! Environment ready.
```

### Integration with P3 Workflows
```python
# Used internally by PR creation workflow
if not validate_environment_for_pr():
    print("‚ùå PR creation aborted due to environment issues")
    sys.exit(1)
```

## Development Utilities Reference

### Environment Health Check (`fast_env_check.py`)
**Purpose**: Fast environment validation for development workflows
**Timeout**: 5 seconds total, 2 seconds per check
**Checks**: Podman machine, Neo4j web interface, Python environment
**Integration**: Used by PR workflows, manual troubleshooting

```bash
# Usage
python scripts/utilities/fast_env_check.py

# Parallel execution ensures fast results
# Clear error messages with specific fix suggestions
# Exit codes: 0 = success, 1 = validation failed
```

### Service Status Validation
**Purpose**: Individual service health checking
**Scope**: All critical development services
**Output**: Detailed status with diagnostic information
**Integration**: Standalone use, workflow integration

### Dependency Validation
**Purpose**: Development dependency verification
**Scope**: Python packages, system tools, configuration files
**Output**: Missing dependencies, version conflicts, configuration issues
**Integration**: Pre-development validation, CI/CD pipeline checks

## Integration Points

### With P3 Workflow System
- **Pre-flight validation**: Environment checks before PR creation
- **Command integration**: Used by `p3 debug` and `p3 ready` commands
- **Error diagnostics**: Detailed troubleshooting for workflow failures

### With Infrastructure Components
- **Service coordination**: Integration with `infra/environment/` management
- **Monitoring integration**: Health status reporting to monitoring systems
- **Automation support**: Used by deployment and setup scripts
