# Scripts Directory Migration Complete

**Migration Status**: All infrastructure scripts have been successfully migrated to `infra/` directory structure.

## Migration Summary

All scripts previously in `scripts/` have been moved to the appropriate modules in `infra/`:

- **System tools** → `infra/system/`
- **Development tools** → `infra/development/`
- **P3 CLI components** → `infra/p3/`
- **Data management** → `infra/data/`
- **Git operations** → `infra/git/`
- **HRBP automation** → `infra/hrbp/`

## What to do

- **Use the new paths**: All scripts are now in `infra/` modules
- **Remove old scripts**: Old `scripts/` files can be safely removed
- **Check p3.py**: The P3 CLI already uses new `infra/` paths

## Completed Actions

✅ All workflow scripts migrated to `infra/system/`
✅ All development tools migrated to `infra/development/`
✅ P3 version management migrated to `infra/p3/`
✅ References in p3.py updated to use new paths
✅ References in create_pr_with_test.py updated
