Okay, I need to create a DCF analysis report based on the provided data about AMZN Inc. as of August 21, 2025. Let me start by understanding what each section requires.

First, the Executive Summary should be concise, summarizing key points like revenue growth, financial metrics, and management quality. I'll need to extract the main trends from the given data.

Next is the Management Quality Score. This depends on the CEO's experience and leadership changes. Since the CEO name isn't provided, but the executive_analysis section has details about leadership age, tenure, etc., I can use that. The score should be 1-10, with younger leadership usually better. I'll look at ceo_age and tenure to assess.

For Market Growth Potential, I need to see if revenue is growing or declining over the past five years. Revenue growth_5y is 0.078, which is positive but low. The market_capacity_estimate is 0, suggesting a decline. So, it's a medium potential.

R&D Efficiency: The R&D Spending Efficiency section shows RD points as 0. I'll compare this to industry average. If it's below, that's a concern. But since data isn't available, maybe it's considered Below.

5-Year Financial Projections need revenue growth rates. Revenue is increasing but at a conservative pace. EBITDA and FCF should be calculated using the provided financial metrics. I'll use historical trends and add future projections with 20% growth each year.

Valuation Range: The base case uses free cash flow, considering market maturity and moat durability. Optimistic scenario might have higher growth. I need to estimate these scenarios based on industry trends.

Investment Recommendation is based on the financials and valuation. If it's undervalued with strong growth potential, buy. If too high or uncertain, sell.

Risk Factors should list top risks like market volatility affecting R&D. Each point needs a brief explanation of impact.

Catalysts are positive factors driving growth. I'll look at revenue trends, EBITDA growth, and future market conditions.

I need to make sure each section is clear, uses specific numbers where possible, and references industry benchmarks when applicable. Also, ensure the analysis flows logically from executive quality to valuation.
