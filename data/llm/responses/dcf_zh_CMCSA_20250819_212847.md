1. **Executive Summary**: About 3-4 paragraphs, summarizing the main points of the entire analysis. May include the company's growth potential, R&D situation, and investment recommendations.

2. **Management Quality Score**: Based on CEO age and experience background, the score should be relatively high, as younger leadership typically has more innovation capability. But specific numbers need to be determined based on industry data.

3. **Market Growth Potential**: According to market capacity assessment, the growth rate trend is declining, indicating the market may be contracting. Meanwhile, competitive moat sustainability is also a factor, which may mean intensified market competition.

4. **R&D Efficiency Rating**: R&D spending as a percentage of revenue and R&D return on investment need to be compared with industry averages to determine whether it belongs to high or low rating.

5. **5-Year Financial Forecast**: Including revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. These numbers need to be calculated based on company data, and may also need to consider growth rates and industry trends.

6. **Valuation Range**: Divided into conservative, baseline, and optimistic scenarios, depending on the company's growth potential and financial performance. If the company has high growth potential and sound finances, it might be in the optimistic range.

7. **Investment Recommendation**: Based on the previous analysis, recommend buy or hold, especially if management quality is high and financial condition is good.

8. **Risk Factors**: List possible risks and rank them by impact level. Such as market volatility, technology disruption risks, etc.
